# Ravencolonial EDMC Plugin

An Elite Dangerous Market Connector (EDMC) plugin that automatically tracks colonization activities and sends data to [Ravencolonial](https://ravencolonial.com), eliminating the need to run SRVSurvey continuously.

## Features

- **Automatic Tracking**: Monitors your colonization deliveries in real-time
- **Project Creation**: Create new colonization projects directly from EDMC (like SRVSurvey's "Colonize" button)
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with Ravencolonial's existing infrastructure
- **Lightweight**: Runs alongside EDMC with minimal resource usage
- **No Configuration Needed**: Works out of the box after installation
- **Smart UI**: Create Project button only enabled when docked at stations

## What This Plugin Does

This plugin provides the same colonization tracking functionality as SRVSurvey, but integrates directly with EDMC:

- **Create new colonization projects** with an easy-to-use dialog (replicates SRVSurvey's "Colonize" button)
- Tracks cargo deliveries to construction depots
- Automatically reports contributions to Ravencolonial
- Monitors your current projects
- Updates progress in real-time
- Auto-populates project details from journal data
